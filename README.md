# SHAP-analysis

This project performs a SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis on tabular data using the SHAP library and XGBoost for model training. It involves installing the necessary libraries, loading a custom dataset, splitting the data into training and testing sets, training an XGBoost model, and evaluating its accuracy. The project also includes visualizing feature importance using SHAP values and generating force plots to explain individual predictions.
